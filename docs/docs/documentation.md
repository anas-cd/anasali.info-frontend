# Documentation

This project uses [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) for documentation, for more info please refer to their [docs](https://vitepress.dev/guide/getting-started).

::: danger
whenever you build the docs please make sure to copy the `brand/` directory in the `src/docs/assets/` to `src/docs/.vitepress/dist/assets/` and then commit after that.

## Deployment

Currently, the docs need to be manually uploaded to the Hostinger file manager, working on making it automatic.
